# Stock-Market-Performance-EDA
This project is just a tiny fraction of analyzing stock market data with the help of Python since stock analysis includes both technical and fundamental analysis, which is a broad area.The aim of this project is to analyze the stocks of six companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, Infosys and Wipro for past three years i.e., Jan 2021 to Jan 2023 using Python.
This project involves calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, conducting correlation analysis and analyzing various aspects of the stock market to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect stock prices and the relationships between the stock prices of different companies.

# Data Set
Stock Market Performance Analysis project starts by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset. For this task, I used the Yahoo finance API (yfinance) to collect real-time stock market data for the past three years.

# Libraries Used
The following Libraries and tools were used for this Project:
1. yfinance: Yahoo Finance for importing the real-time stock Data
2. Pandas: To Handle Dataframes in Python
3. Numpy: Numerical Python
4. Matplotlib/Seaborn: Plotting Graphs & Visualisation

# Data Description
- Open: The price of stock when Market opens in the morning.
- Close: The price of the stock when the market closed in the evening.
- High: Highest price the stock reached during that day.
- Low: Lowest price the stock is traded on that day.
- Volume: The total amount of stocks traded on that day.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis performed on the stock market data provided the following insights:
- Visualised the graph of Stock Price Performance of all the six Tickers for last three years.
- Over the last three years, Wipro’s stock price performance experienced significant growth.
- On the contrast, as we  analyzed from the graph that Infosys stocks faced a major downfall in the last three years.
- Then we plotted the Area charts collectively of six companies to show their last three years of Stock Prices.
- A line graph of all the six companies’ stocks depicting the last three years of Volume of Stock traded.
- The Data information of Moving Averages of all the stocks by grouping them in MA10 i.e., for 10 days and MA20 i.e., for 20 days respectively.
- We showed the Volatility of all six companies in past three years.
- We plotted the correlations between random pair of companies in terms of their Close dates over the past three years.
